To test the methods that are returning the Boolean values after 
completion we call the method in the test function and store it's 
return values value to the expected true or false and used assertTrue 
and assertFalse.

To test void methods giving output to the terminal we take the output
of the file in the output stream and match it with the expected output
 after copying it from the function itself

Similarly for testing the string returning methods we chech the return 
of the method with the expected using the assertEquals

I have created CommonTestClass to help insert sample data and test CLI using
redirecting System.in from string and storing System.out to a file. 

I have also created Log file that logs almost all changes to database to a file 
and read that file for testing.
